# OxideNDS Engine

![OxideNDS Logo](OxideLogo.svg)

**OxideNDS is still in early development, so breaking changes *may* occur frequently.**

OxideNDS is a game and application engine for the Nintendo DS, written on top of libnds.

It provides (or will provide) higher-level functionality for common elements of software (2D sprites, 3D models, audio, etc.) to facilitate and simplify NDS software development. However, it is also intended to be flexible, so if you want to ignore the bigger functionality and work directly with the structs and simpler functions as your own building blocks, you can do that too.

Note that OxideNDS ***isn't*** intended to 'replace' any of the available code or tools from DevkitPro's toolchain and/or libnds, and isn't recommended to be used as your first NDS development experience. Try to make sure you have some experience and understanding of what's going on under the hood first, so you, me and the toolchain maintainers will be saved a lot of headaches from questions that could be solved by doing things properly in the first place.

## Dependencies

OxideNDS only requires a devkitPro installation providing devkitARM, libnds and the tools, including GRIT.

The environment variables `DEVKITPRO=/path/to/devkitpro` and `DEVKITARM=/path/to/devkitARM` should be available in the compilation environment, and `${DEVKITPRO}/tools/bin` should be on your PATH. These are standard for any installation which follows devkitPro's instructions.
