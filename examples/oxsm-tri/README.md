# oxsm-tri

This example demonstrates rendering an untextured, uncolored triangle mesh loaded from a .oxsm file in the NitroFS.

The .obj file which was converted to .oxsm format using oxsmconv is included in the `nitrofs` directory for simplicity's sake, but you should be careful not to include unused files in your project's NitroFS as they will take up valuable space.
